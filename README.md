# Welcome to Animal Kingdom

## Notice

I am currently upgrading this project with a new Anchor program and a new Next.js front-end

## Overview

This is a project exploring the potential of NFTs and DAOs on Solana for the protection of nature.

It looks primarily at two things:

1. How NFTs can be used to enable people to invest in the protection and ongoing support of specific habitats, animal communities and animals.

2. How DAOs can be used to enable people to come together to protect specific areas of nature (for example a DAO to protect and maintain a specific patch of forest).

## Progress Status: Work In Progress

Current progress: Just built the first draft of the front-end for the NFT aspect. Deployed [here](https://animal-kingdom-nft-front-end.vercel.app/).

Program id (devnet): DtjytkXbXgEznoBWJMufeGxRPbThhn47kKU418U8as1g

Next Step: Create the backend for the NFT aspect.

## Technologies used

Once completed, the project will have used:

- Solana
- Rust
- Anchor
- Next.js
- React
- Javascript
