# Welcome to the Animal Kingdom

## Overview

This is a project exploring the potential of NFTs and DAOs on Solana for the protection of nature.

It looks primarily at two things:

1. How NFTs can be used to enable people to invest in the protection and ongoing support of specific habitats, animal communities and animals.

2. How DAOs can be used to enable people to come together to protect specific areas of nature (for example a DAO to protect and maintain a specific patch of forest).

## Progress Status: Work In Progress

Current progress:

- Just created the Animal Kingdom token on devnet. Here is the [mint address](ESarL2od3DGvFA9N89cosE9LvJdgjvdwFLmb2iHav7C5) on Solana explorer. It looks like it is not unique, so I will have to think of a new name when deploying to mainnet.
- Just created the first Animal Kingdom NFTs. The Candy Machine address is 4hqoKaA1LPd2Fm5RaAgZhCiXb3AuCigCiduziQ33yALy. See the candy machine on [Solaneyes](https://www.solaneyes.com/address/4hqoKaA1LPd2Fm5RaAgZhCiXb3AuCigCiduziQ33yALy?cluster=devnet). See the collection mint on [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/9K7VADXjhepWgutywVbtAGKRqCBn132jwXUJpu1GkmZh?cluster=devnet)
- Updated the front-end to allow people to mint NFTs from the collection

Next Step: Need to add further functionality to the NFTs so that they can actually fulfil their intended function of helping protect and nurture real-life habitats and animals. Need to also figure out how to impose controls on who can create a new NFT collection to ensure that only genuine projects helping protect habitats and animals create NFTs.
